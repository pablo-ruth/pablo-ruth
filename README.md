### About me

As a seasoned Linux, Kubernetes, and AWS administrator with an interest in open source, I bring a strong skillset to any project.

Having worked in both freelance and in-house roles, I've developed proficiency in Kubernetes cluster administration, AWS architecture and automation, infrastructure as code, and Go tool development.

My experience includes designing and securing Kubernetes clusters and AWS infrastructures, automating deployments with Ansible and Gitlab CI, and coaching teams on technologies like Docker, Vault, and Terraform. I also have strong Linux administration skills and expertise in networking and web technologies such as Nginx, Haproxy, and Envoy.

I continuously stay up to date on the latest technology trends, eager to expand my knowledge and contribute to successful projects.
